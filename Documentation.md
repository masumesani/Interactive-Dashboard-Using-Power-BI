## User Story

As a **Business Intelligence Analyst for AdventureWorks Cycles**, I want to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards. 
This will enable me to track **Key Performance Indicators** (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. 
Following the key stages of the business intelligence workflow, I aim to simulate real-world tasks that data professionals encounter on the job.
