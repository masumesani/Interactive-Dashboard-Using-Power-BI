## Business Understanding <a name= "workflow"></a>
As a Business Intelligence Analyst for Adventure Work's Cycles, I want to transform raw data into professional-quality reports and dashboards. This will enable me to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), compare regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers. 
For more information about detailed steps and phase please check project documentation here: https://github.com/masumesani/Interactive-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI/blob/main/Documentation.md#user-story
Understanding the Landscape:

Adventure Works operates in a dynamic landscape with diverse territories, a rich product portfolio, and a customer base with unique preferences. Each territory holds varying sales potential, each product category caters to specific needs, and understanding customer buying patterns is crucial for success.

Challenges and Opportunities:

Navigating this complex landscape presents challenges. Optimizing sales across territories, ensuring product offerings align with customer demand, and addressing potential issues reflected in returns all require deep insights. However, these challenges also bring tremendous opportunities. Data-driven analysis of Adventure Works unlocks the potential to:

Maximize territorial sales: Identify high-performing areas, understand regional nuances, and tailor strategies for optimal sales growth.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For privecy concerns I mask any personal info.

> [!Tip]
> Since any app on [Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/) including Power BI needs to upgrade to **Power BI Pro** or **Power BI Premium** to share reports, and I work on [Power BI desktop ](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/), I had to just publish the result as PDF format.
> 
> For sharing code I also needed [GitHub template app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-github) wich is unavailble for my scheme I am looking for a solution to add my DAX and M code here until then I just add whole project here.
