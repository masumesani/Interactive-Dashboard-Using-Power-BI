> For privecy concerns I mask any personal info.

> [!Tip]
> Since any app on [Power Platform](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/) including Power BI needs to upgrade to **Power BI Pro** or **Power BI Premium** to share reports, and I work on [Power BI desktop ](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/), I had to just publish the result as PDF format.
> 
> For sharing code I also needed [GitHub template app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-github) wich is unavailble for my scheme I am looking for a solution to add my DAX and M code here until then I just add whole project here.
